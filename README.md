# NetScrapy
Small tool for scraping pages, with Playwright included. 

# Usage
Create a file following the json schema config. Build the solution (install Playwright's dependencies if needed), and run with config.json file as an argument. 

# Storage
For now you have to have SQL Server installed locally with the ScrapyDB database. Run the migrations and you're good to go.
